- The borrower rate increases with the term of the loan
- there is a positive correlation between variables, BorrowerRate, borrowerAPR estimatedLoss
- The term is directly correlated with the estimated return from the loans
- The most common loan term is 36 months followed by 60 months. A 12 month repayment time is hte least popular among the loans offered to the cleints by the bank.
- The 36 month loan term is so popular that it more than doubles the number of loans taken under the 60 month term.
- Loans with long term payment have a low Annual Percentage Rate offered ot the buyer. This is seen in the chart below where the loans with terms of 36 and 60 months have a lower APR compared ot those of 12 months. The 36 Month long term has outliers which can be analysed further for indepth udnerstanding fo the reason.
